                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Noah Krohngold. I'm a computer science major at the
                    University of Washington. Throughout my education, I've been
                    involved in a variety of activities like DECA and FBLA (two
                    marketing clubs), FIRST Robotics, the Boy Scouts of America,
                    and Google's CSSI. I'm really into basketball and I play
                    tennis in my free-time. At UW, I'm involved with UW ACM and
                    the Korean Student Association. I also review movies when I
                    get the chance, but I'm working on transitioning these reviews
                    into a YouTube channel. Thanks for visiting!

                        The American Psyche - internally known as Twitter Trend Sentiment utilized
                        <span style="color:#025dad">Twitter's Trending Topics API</span> and 
                        <span style="color:#025dad">Google's Natural Language Processing API</span>
                        to determine the sentiment of a trending topic. Users could search for major
                        cities and observe whether or not the summation of all teh city's trending
                        topics resulted in a positive, neutral, or sad/angry attitude. This project
                        was developed at Google's CSSI in 2019 in collaboration with Ethan Buranday
                        and Jason Li.

                        Serv gave any business or group that queues customers easy cacess to basic
                        business metrics as well as customer management. Groups that partnered with
                        Serv would receive an NFC tag that patrons would activate with their phone
                        and enter their contact infomration into upon being redirected to our
                        website, allowing the user to continue their day elsewhere while waiting for
                        their appointment or reservation. Once the business had an opening for the
                        patron, they would receive a text informing the patron to return to the
                        business soon, or their spot would be forfeited. This project was developed
                        at NWHacks 2020 in collaboration with Johnny Li, Byeongjun Moon, Maya Evans,
                        and Frank Whoee.
