                        Having grown up in the suburbs of Seattle, I've been lucky enough
                        to experience the lush environments of the Cascade mountain range.
                        My participation in the Boy Scouts of America also gave me plenty
                        of exposure to wildlife, and as such I enjoy taking pictures of
                        trees and mountains. Nature provides an excellent break from 
                        technology, and while it seems ironic that I use technology to 
                        capture the moment I like to take a little piece of nature back
                        home with me after a trip.

                        While they don't always make for the best picture, any time where
                        there's open water with the sun or the moon I race for my camera.
                        I live near a popular park that sits on the Puget Sound, so photos
                        of the Sound dominate my photo gallery. I have a lot of fond 
                        memories at this park, and the nearby boat launch area features
                        a kayak rental shop. The area around the park sees a lot of
                        investment today, with hotels and residencies opening up to 
                        increase interest in the area, and given the views available I
                        think that interest and investment is warranted.

                        Monuments and cultural structures always capture my attention. The
                        history and effort put into each building once made me want to
                        pursue architecture, but seeing as my artistic skills aren't
                        exactly the best I decided to keep my admiration of architecture
                        while moving onto other career prospects. I took this picture
                        while I was in Korea, and this mini-temple sits on a backroad within
                        Seoul. Strangely, on the other side of the street are apartment
                        complexes and just down the road is a bustling night market, so 
                        this structure doesn't really fit anywhere.

                        Ever since night-photography became so easy with smartphones, I
                        snap a picture whenever there's something worthy of a picture,
                        often resulting in a cool effect where the prominent color in
                        frame blows up and floods the photo. UW's quad is seen here, 
                        where instead of the iconic cherry blossoms during Spring the
                        glaze on the brick pathways create a cool reflection of the 
                        nearby lights while the snow contrasts the dark aspect of the
                        image. My only disappointment is that the left part of the image
                        with the trees gets blown out because there either wasn't
                        enough light or the exposure wasn't long enough.
